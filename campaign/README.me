Campaign Mode

I took the inital concept and decided to create a level by level scenario. 

I modified the Sandbox code and decided to run this section by using $_SESSION variables. 

Starting the Game would set the first variables i.e. X = 1 and Y = 1 / Lives =3 

As you progress the X and Y values would increment by 1 (alternating i.e. X=2 and Y=1 then X=2 and Y=2 etc...)

I set a colour array to mix up the Square colours a bit - being careful not to set a color that matched the Losing/Winning/Hover Square colours. 

Early on in the development I found you could "Cheat" by refreshing the page once you lost. This was resolved by unset($_POST) after $_POST variables were called on. 

This means if you loose and try to refresh you would be brought back to the starting point. 

In Theory you could progress to X=infinity and Y=infinity however the majority of people by this point would have lost or given up. 

There is a method to always win - as my Wife pointed out! (I will not be telling you - hint simple Math)

Again as with Sandbox there is a mobile compatible version which will automatically load on a mobile device.
