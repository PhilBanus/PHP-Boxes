<h4>PHP Grid Game </h4>

<p> There are currently two modes, when loading index.php, you will be prompted to play either Sandbox mode or Campaign mode.</p>

<p> The game idea is simple, you have a grid of squares to choose from. When the user clicks on a square they will then be told if they won or lost. </p>

Campaign mode - User has 3 lives per a level, the levels progressively harder (1x1 then 2x1 , 2x2, etc.. ) They will be told on each attempt how far they are away from the Winning Square.

Sandbox mode - user picks X x Y grid and has one chance to find the winning square. Map mode can be toggled on or off.
